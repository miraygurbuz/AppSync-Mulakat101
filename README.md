```
npm install
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

3. Initialize Amplify:

```
amplify init
```

4. Add necessary Amplify resources:

```
amplify add auth        # Adds Cognito authentication
amplify add api         # Adds AppSync GraphQL API
amplify add storage     # Adds S3 storage for images
amplify add function    # Adds Lambda function for content moderation

## System Flow

- Users register and authenticate through AWS Cognito, receiving JWT tokens for API access
- The frontend built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS provides a responsive user interface
- Users can browse, post, and interact with the content
- Content is stored in DynamoDB while image files are stored in S3
- GraphQL API (AppSync) enables efficient data querying
- Lambda functions handle content moderation
- CloudWatch monitors system performance and provides real-time metrics

## Technology Benefits

- **Serverless Architecture:** Eliminates the need for server management, reducing operational overhead
- **GraphQL API:** Provides flexible data queries, reducing unnecessary data transfers
- **Scalability:** Automatic scaling based on demand without manual intervention
